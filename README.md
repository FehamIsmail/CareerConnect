<h1>CareerConnect</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
This project will provide a career services platform where students (job seekers) can post and update their portfolios and employers can post job openings. This platform will help both job seekers and employers to shortlist potential job and employee respectively.

<h2>Objective:</h2>
The objective of this project is to work in teams using GitHub as a version control tool and track all the changes that are brought on this project. It will be an introduction to software project management, using the Agile approach. User stories are to be used, the different parts of GitHub are to be exploited (Issues, Pull Requests, Wiki, etc). The end product is expected to be a compelling middle-fidelity prototype that can serve as the basis for defining a real product.
